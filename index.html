China intellectual properties and protection
	I would think that China's copyright laws are really good! They have been protecting copyright things since 1979, and it' still running strong so i think it will good for a long time. I underdtand that some people would not like this because some people think they are able to take someone else's hard work and use it in some of their work.

that basically you are able to sell your work if you want to but you can sell someone else work, but you can sell your work.
 
			<a href="contact.html">case law</a>
since 1990  In most cases the copyright term is the life of the author plus 50 years, but for cinematographic and photographic works and works created by a company or organization the term is 50 years after first publication.
