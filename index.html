	China intellectual properties and protection
	I would think that China's copyright laws are really good! They have been protecting copyright things since 1979, and it' still running strong so i think it will good for a long time. I underdtand that some people would not like this because some people think they are able to take someone else's hard work and use it in some of their work.
